This is a real text message I received when I was working in tech in London, in a tiny startup. At the time, I had a coworker who constantly made racist jokes—some general, some at my expense. He is Indian (I think). I assumed the text was from him. 

After a while, when chatting at work, I mentioned the text and told him I just assumed it was from him and kept my distance. He was shocked. He said it wasn’t him, and he honestly thought all the jokes were just laughs and giggles, he would never intentionally hurt me, and that he will think twice going forward because he does not want to be considered as someone who can send this kind of texts.

There are different flavors of racism. Oddly, the text felt like a preferable form—compared to being insulted to my face, or compared to not even knowing that someone dislikes me because of my race.

I spent 5 years in the UK and 5 years on and off in the States, and I prefer the British and European form of racism in comparison to the American ones.

Many racist people in the States will never admit it. And because they don’t, it makes me question everything about myself—not just my skin color; my gender, my appearance, my competency, my language skills, and many more. 

If I just knew it was my skin color that upset them, I could leave everything else about me intact. 

I believed him. But it still changed something.
