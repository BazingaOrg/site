Don’t worry—still here. Just stepping off the Taiwanese zeitgeist.

I know I probably shouldn't spend precious time amid the movement to write this, but I’m finding it really hard to concentrate on anything else if I don’t take stock of everything that’s happened so far.

I’m not suited for, nor capable of surviving in a community like this.

I’m deeply disappointed in everyone—most of all, myself: my (in)abilities, expectations, and judgment. I naively held out hope for every quiet onlooker who said nothing. That was my foolishness.

The fact that all this is happening while I’m going through SNRI withdrawal and in the worst health of my life just shows how badly I overestimated my abilities. I thought too highly of myself to believe I could somehow do it all—push through and make a dent.

I wish Taiwan, our beautiful island, many more who are capable—psychologically and physically. People willing to give up their peace and comfort. Strong enough to carry on.

I’ve quit twice now. Nothing to show for it.

What power to influence?

I’m not losing my values—just recognizing my very limited reach and abilities, and taking a step back so I don't fall off a cliff.

P.S. If you found this before the end of May (when I might officially publish it), know that I do not want to distract anyone from what matters most right now—the movement. I’m saying this now because it’s raw, and saying it later wouldn’t be the same. Please keep it to yourself. This is where I choose to be authentic.
