Apologies for the lack of updates. I have been busy with the local political movement. It is going to be a long one. I have yet been able to find one reporting in English that is comprehensive enough so this is it as of now.

The long and short of it is that we have an assume recall movement to vote out had of the law makers in congress for their gross misconduct. And this issue is made to be extremely polarizing where one side (mine) thinks democracy dies in darkness and the other side thinks the recalls are a waste of taste payer money and that the whole movement was run by a political party, which cannot be further from the truth.

I think about the issues most waking minutes and wonder what more I can do. So that is it for now.

Hope Mu-An‚Äôs note readers are doing well. Like this note to let me know you‚Äôre still around? Peace. ‚úåüèº
