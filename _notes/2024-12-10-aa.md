So I got a rash around my eyes and it has been getting worse day by day, so I went to a demonologist. And she said people, like you, with allergic predisposition, really shouldn’t have cats. 

????? “I have literally never been allergic to things and I did the major 50 allergen test the only thing I was properly allergic to is dust mites. This is the first time ever I heard that I am predisposed to allergy.”

She said “well somethings you only know when it happens”
