Perhaps there's an interesting dichotomy wrt the experencr of  getting to know people here in Berlin and in Taiwan. Chatting with people in Berlin is inherently interesting because of the vast differences of social and cultural backgrounds, and you learn something every time, if you know how and what to ask. Whereas chatting with Taiwanese I think I tend to find commonality rather than differences, since differences are more likely to lead to disagreements, perhaps? I wonder. And there’s also the case that I find people in Berlin a lot more open to deep chats, be it politics, psychology, religions, which is my jam. 

“You’re a great conversationist” a new friend said to me. I will take this win. (grabs)
