Perhaps it’s an interesting dichotomy how I find getting to know people here and in Taiwan. Chatting with foreigners is inherently interesting because of the vast cultural backgrounds, and you learn something every time if you know how to ask. Whereas chatting with Taiwanese I think we tend to find commonality rather than differences, since differences are more likely to lead to disagreements? I wonder. And there’s also the case that I find people in Berlin a lot more open to deep chats, which is my jam. 

“You’re a great conversationist” a new friend said to me. I will take this win. (grabs)
