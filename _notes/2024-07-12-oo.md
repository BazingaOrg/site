Corporate feminism is the death of all women who want to stay an IC. 

So tired of managerial women who only manage up and not down. Blocking growth of their reports for their personal gains. Cultivating a male managerial ally is way easier than trying to get a corporate feminist to give a shit about us.

Talk is worthless.
