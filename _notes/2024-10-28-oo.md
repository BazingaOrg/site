I’m watching an interview with Robert Sapolsky and it’s making me wonder if growing up with a hypocritical façade of Christianity trained me to be skeptical of what’s being preached to me. Made me prone to ask, "but why?"

The most lovely performance review I had received was from my mentor at GitHub who wrote in the last paragraph:

<details><summary>&lt;CW: Praise about me&gt;</summary>She has a keen eye for potential technical complexity and asks simple, direct, disarming questions about new proposals. Asking “why?” makes our team better because it develops our understanding of tradeoffs internally so that we can provide detailed advice on feature teams’ pull requests.</details>

Anyways, Robert Sapolsky just said “I am beyond ignorant on this topic” when asked about something. Being able to just say I don’t know while curious makes a cool person.
