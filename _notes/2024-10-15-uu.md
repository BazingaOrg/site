Hey yo I am actually coding again. Just released [a public API for OpenHeart](https://github.com/dddddddddzzzz/api-oh). If you haven’t tried it out this should get you in quickly!

I also have an iOS app in TestFlight and just released more invites to my site that has been collecting dust and paying Heroku server fee for a while https://en.zakka.reviews/. Unfortunately I haven’t figure out how English and Chinese content is supposed to co-exist so have not yet send out any invites to my English speaker friends.
