Over the last few months I have gotten a lot more rooted in the Taiwanese society. Perhaps it’s surprising to hear that but that’s a story for another time.

I have three disappointing discoveries—amongst people who are supposed to match my political spectrum, the majority are:

- against gender neutral restrooms
- firmly standing with the Israeli government
- for the death penalty

What’s sadder is I see their point. I don’t agree but I understand why and I don’t think they are unreasonable (except the death penalty but alas had it ever been a topic to reason?)
