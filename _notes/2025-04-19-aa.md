Over the last few months I have gotten a lot more rooted in the Taiwanese society. It’s probably surprising to hear that given how much I tried to avoid it before, but that’s a story for another time.

I have three disappointing discoveries—amongst people who supposingly are on the same political spectrum. The majority of them are:

- against gender neutral restrooms
- firmly standing with the Israeli government
- for the death penalty

What’s sadder is, I kind of see their point. I don’t agree, but I understand why, and I don’t think they are *irrational* and baseless. Except the death penalty, but alas, has it ever been a topic to _reason with_?
