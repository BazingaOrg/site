Therapy the other day, a break-through is that now I reward myself for self-actualization—I aspire to be someone who strives for what is just and kind, and I do. In this aspect I do quite well as a human-being. I don’t do it perfectly but at least I *strive* and I introspect.

In the past I have thought being a decent human being is the baseline, and is not to be rewarded. But you know what? I am a nice person. Much nicer than a lot of people. I deserve a pat on the back. I deserve to not feel shit about myself.
