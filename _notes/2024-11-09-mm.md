> To improve the current state of the Web we don’t need more tech. We don’t need ActivityPub. We don’t need microformats. We don’t need WebMentions. We don’t need federation. We just need you to care. We need you to care enough to do your part.

*your part: open a text editor, create an `index.html`, put that on the internet. that is all.
