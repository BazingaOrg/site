Re: Trump & Zelensky I once again find it odd that a reaction is once again expected from us. “Taiwanese people should be really worried now” like we haven’t seen bullies before? When have we ever lived in certain safety? No one was ever a reliable ally. I ran out of reaction points for Trump so long ago.
