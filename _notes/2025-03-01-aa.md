Re: Trump & Zelensky I once again find it odd that a reaction is expected from us. “Taiwanese people should be really worried now” like we haven’t seen bullies before? When have we ever lived in certain safety? No one was ever a reliable ally. I ran out of reaction points for Trump so long ago. 

step one: trump said something
step two: can I do anything about it
step three: can I get my American friends to do anything about it
stept four: repeat step one to step three a bunch of times and then stop caring
