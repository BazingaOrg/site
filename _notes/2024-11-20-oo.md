A friend said that going to the city for nice street food is a good treat to oneself that I should consider. I told her itâ€™s 1.5 hour to and from. If I take public transportation then itâ€™s 2 hours to and from plus time and energy. 

Energy is the most precious resource in my life since I am still averaging 4 hour ish 2-part sleeps. Then the more time the more energy expenditure. And time + energy is also a resource I use to make money.

Anyways, the cost of going out is astronomically high because it is simply not replenish-able. ðŸ˜ž
