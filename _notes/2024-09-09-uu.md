FWIW I am still trying to do all that I can to fix my chronic insomnia (3 years strong). There are many things I wish I could do but I couldnâ€™t because I need to prioritize my sleep hygiene - rid of insomnia - rid of major depression, one day. 

Thanks but no thanks for reminding me that my apartment is messy, pointing out the bags of garbage at the door, and that the potatoes on the counter is sprouting.

I am proud that right now my sink is empty.
