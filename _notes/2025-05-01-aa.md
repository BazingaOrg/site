Can men shut up about the Fediverse already? The level of abuse and harassment that goes unchecked on Fediverse is staggering.  

It is not even popular, yet the amount of harassment and unwanted contact I get is already too much.

I am not surprised that men like ActivityPub, which coincidently is designed by men.
