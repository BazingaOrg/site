Remember the sleep analysis session I said I was gonna do? I did it. They told me the report would be out in 2 weeks. I asked for a specific date but they wouldn’t give one to me and instead just told me to just make a doctor’s appointment in 2 weeks.

I did that. I waited in line for about an hour. Only to be told that the report isn’t ready yet.

I said OK, made another appointment, and went home.

That was last week. I wonder if I should have been more bothered by that. But what do I gain from reacting?

Anyways. In my Apple Health state of mind log, my mood is 70% “indifferent” and 30% “drained.”
