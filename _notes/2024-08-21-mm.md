The adoption center told me since the cats I adopted are feral, they wouldn’t hold it against me if I chose DNR if it came to it. And they apologized for being so direct. 

I almost responded with way too much information—I signed DNR for myself already… it’s only logical???

Anyways I am stuck with these two, 8.5yo and 2.5yo bbs. They celebrated our first day officially together by peeing on my couch.
