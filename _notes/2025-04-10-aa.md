Hot take Mu-An is back. It’s unethical to build websites that encourage sending PII over the internet — for a social movement, or for anything.

As web developers, we really fucking failed the public. The web is a minefield, and the least we can do is teach people how to spot or disarm the mines we let get planted.

The lack of assumed social responsibility in tech is honestly staggering. Fuck this industry.
