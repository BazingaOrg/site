This is the fifth post I am about to write to promote [marcel.fyi](https://marcel.fyi) because he deserves it. 

- He is a delightful, humorous, and introspective person. I highly recommend [his blog](https://marcel.io) and his in real life presence.
- He built [Unhinged](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/mood-tracker-unhinged/id6501954555), an excellent mood tracking app (iOS) featuring delightful app screenshots in the app store.
- He has a cat called Millmeter that seems like a great cat, as all cats are.
- He is now [building in public over on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tiptopsoftware) using Reels. So courageous of him to be trying out new media formats at our age. His content is honestly not cringe at all. I am not being sarcastic. They are very well-done but not over the top.
- All the things that he’s been doing are things I wish I could do. But I can’t. So I am living vicariously through his journey. 

Please check him out and follow him so I am no longer a lone overly enthusiastic super fan. It’s creepy. I am creeping myself out writing this note. I have posted his reel on all 3 of my Instagram accounts and on mastodon, all with different promotion content. It just flows out because I am really such a ~creep~fan. Please take over fan-personing him for me.
