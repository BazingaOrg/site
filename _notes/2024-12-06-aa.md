I really love [Unhinged](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/unhinged-mood-journal/id6501954555) by [Marcel](https://marcel.io). One might say the naming is unfortunately if you were actually unhinged, but I think it’s important to own and accept your feelings and mental state.

<details><summary>Content warning—on a more unhinged note</summary>

I have been thinking about creating a suicidal ideation tracker, because “feeling very bad” is just not enough. I feel like having SI meter rated would help my psychiatrist determine my situation better. I could feel very bad because I had a fall out with someone but my SI are usually not tied to other people. Not being able to regulate the emotion hurts me more than the emotion.

However I haven’t been able to figure out the scale… like imagine the mildest being “I am meeting a friend later so death can wait” to “ready to put on proper attire and investigate the bridge, probably with my dumbbell.” In the middle there are trickier stages like “if I can die with a button press now and pass on the chance, do I lose this easy way out forever?”

I told my therapist all about this and we have set another session so nothing to be concerned with here. Or I should say, a professional is on it and I am cooperating because I know the alternative (not seeking help and also not being able to act things) is worse.
