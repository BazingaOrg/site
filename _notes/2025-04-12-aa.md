Friends, I have added the following annoouncement on my website, please come by some time: [muan.co](https://muan.co)–I quote:

To every Taiwanese voter, and to the foreign friends who care about them, and me—there’s a nation-wide recall movement happening now in Taiwan, ending around late April.

Find all all signing locations this weekend in the US, Europe, AU and NZ: [world.bafu.tw](https://world.bafu.tw)

For resources in Mandarin, see [watchout.tw’s feature series](https://watchout.tw/projects/2025-big-recall).
If you prefer English, I wrote a [gist about the recall](https://gist.github.com/muan/0a84cf0286da578c0653b69e964d072a).

Please take the time to get informed and act. It matters. Thank you. ♥︎
