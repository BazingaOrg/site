Ref: [The Gentleman’s Guide to the Calling Card](https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/etiquette/the-gentlemans-guide-to-the-calling-card/) & [May I See You Home? 19th Century Calling Cards Guaranteed to Score You a Date](https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/relationships/may-i-see-you-home-19th-century-calling-cards-guaranteed-to-score-you-a-date/)—Turns out I accidentally printed these in a letter-printing workshop many years ago in Japan. Thanks to [Jessica](https://jlord.computer) for reminding me that I did it PLUS keeping a copy of it to this day ♥︎. Since I just printed my business card and a bunch of stickers, I am now in a graphic design kick. Gonna use my Pantone Color Guides, right? Postcards friend, expect a calling card from me soon-ish. It’ll read “Thought of me? mail me.” ☺️

BTW Yes I also made Taipei Brezelclub stickers, in the style of Taipei Metro and Berlin U-Bahn style ;) If you have had [my pretzels](https://instagram.com/muanbakes), get in touch if you want some stickers! I haven’t felt like baking for a while unfortunately.
