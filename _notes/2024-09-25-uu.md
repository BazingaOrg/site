To the very nice man at the lost and found counter in Berlin airport, you will never see this, but after being dismissed by two of your coworkers a week ago, who firmly told me that they definitely do not have what I lost, you taking the time before your workday starts to accommodate my early flight and using Find My to track down my AirPod Case in the massive storage room, made my day. Bless you.
