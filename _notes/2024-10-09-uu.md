Anatomie d’une chute (2023): Relatable.
  
<details><summary>spoilers</summary>
I agree there is zero motive from her according to their fight because killing him really does not benefit her in anyway, she has been the one trying to de-escalate the whole time. At the same time, I don’t think someone who wants to die would do it in such a stupid way. This really does not in any shape of form seemed like a reliable way to die. Perhaps his judgment was impaired somehow someway. The killing blow was the blunt trauma. If that blunt trauma did not happen then he would still be alive. I just don’t buy that. He was so lucky to have succeeded with such a stupid method. I guess unless she wanted to sell more books? But still that does not align with her character. So she is acquitted, but I guess the investigation should go on?</details>
  
Anyway, I don’t think that’s the point of the film. The courtroom procedures are ridiculous. The lawyer is hot. I like the writing.
