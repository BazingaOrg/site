I did a lot of planning today and realized that I grew up with people who don’t plan.

I am not a planner. I run on impulse too. But I think the key difference is that I am, in comparison to them, more concerned with how my lack of planning would affect others.

That is not to say I always have people’s best interest in mind. A lot of the times I calculated and I genuinely can’t/don’t care. 

Today I *called* (incredible for a millennial) multiple institutions to get clarification, and made plans on how my eventual form that is a corpse shall be disposed of in accordance to the Taiwanese law without involving people I have not paid to be involved.
