[Against software development](https://www.rntz.net/post/against-software-development.html):

> To those who have a choice:
> 
> Refuse to work on systems that profit from digital addictions.
> Refuse to work on systems that centralize control of media.
> Refuse to work on systems that prop up an unjust status quo.
> Refuse to work on systems that require unsustainable tradeoffs.
> Refuse to work on systems that weaponize the fabric of society.
> 
> Above all, refuse to work on systems that understand and manipulate people, but offer no affordance for their subjects to understand and manipulate them.
