Quoting a friend:

> if you’re at the level of “will my California king fit European ikea sheets” maybe you should use that privilege to effect change in the US and not run for the door?

I had to explain again to my bankers today why I’d never go back to the US and that it is also not a fate I wish on any non-Americans. 

IDK about you but I’m making a move to Berlin for my happiness but yours truly also just applied to join a Taiwanese political 3rd party. It asked if come the chance I’d want to be nominated for public positions… no way in hell. I do think I am smarter than the clowns out there but I don’t need more factors to be depressed. I just want them to please use my skills but I have found that it is hard to convince non-tech people why my approach to website building would be better than the average web engineer.
