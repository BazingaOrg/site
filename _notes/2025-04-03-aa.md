I wrote about [what is happening in Taiwan](https://gist.github.com/muan/0a84cf0286da578c0653b69e964d072a) from just snippets of text with friends and expanded upon it. This is political movement is literally taking every waking minute of mine. It’d mean a lot to me if you read or even share this. Don’t even read anything else I post, ever. Just this.
