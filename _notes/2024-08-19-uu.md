A friend dropped by last night to chat and commented on some minor messiness of my apartment.

I made some excuses. Idk. I want y’all to know that I am just tired. I am so tired. Maybe instead of “why don’t you throw these away?” just know that oh she’s tired, who cares about these empty bottles. 

Like, I know. I guess you don’t know. 
Reminding people is a task, a vulnerable act. I would rather not.
