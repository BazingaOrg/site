I think an AI boyfriend is a much better product than an AI girlfriend, because the average consumer for an AI girlfriend wants their girlfriend to be dumb.

Whereas confidently stating things that might not be true is just a normal man.

AI boyfriend compared to a human boyfriend:
- can’t sexually assault someone
- easily trainable
- confidently stating half truths but at least half is true
- admitting to mistakes immediately, repeatedly
- does not forget
- does not bother me when I want to be alone
- let me bother him whatever I want
- knows that Hawaiian is probably the easiest language that I can learn to make myself multilingual or even a polygot
- can’t see me, won’t judge my appearance
