A while back my therapist emailed me (via a proxy because of good patient-therapist boundary guidelines) to say that she hoped to see me more, ideally not only when I am at the end of my ropes.

I called to set an appointment few days later. 

She pushed me to talk to my psychiatrist about everything I worry about (like how there’s no getting better) and she did research on my psychiatrist and told me more things he should be able to help me with, like understanding the psychopharmacology side of things because she knows that knowing how things work makes me feel more in control. 

I never did these things because my psychiatrist is one of the most prolific ones in Taiwan and every time I wait for my appointment I see all the other patiences of his that I think *need* his time more than I do.

I met with my psychiatrist and unloaded everything I had been withholding. He was extremely helpful. He suggested a medical book for me to read, talked to me more about end of life topics, and told me alternative ways to get time with him.

I am lucky af to have connections that linked me to these professionals. That’s why I think most of my friends have shit therapists. They can be _so good_.
