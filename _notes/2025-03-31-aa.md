Me: (calls) Sorry to wake you up but KH?
Friend: Oh no way. So far. So tiring. Thought we said to hang at yours?
Me: Yea but I suddenly want to go to KH. It’s raining in Taipei, it’s upsetting.
Friend: True. But I can’t. You should go!
Me: Well if you’re coming I’d rather hang out and chill at mine than going to KH by myself.
Friend: Alright let me sleep some more and I’ll go to yours.
