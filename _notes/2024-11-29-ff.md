Asked some friends if they’d be willing to be my testament executor and freaked them out. I guess I’ll try to source more lawyers, or more morbid friends.

My lawyer has agreed (with a fee obviously) but he, being the same age as me, suggested that I find someone younger. Presumptuous of him to assume we will both die of old age.
