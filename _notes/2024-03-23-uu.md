My insomnia has leveled up and now I wake up perhaps 3-8 times a night. This morning I stopped sleeping, stood up, fell face forward onto a protruding corner of a wall, and am now rocking a big cheekbone bruise.

Donâ€™t worry. I am making an appointment to get a monitored sleep session at a hospital to see wtf is wrong with me.
