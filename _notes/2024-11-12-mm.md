There is this internet person that I have met in real life that I have been wanting to become better friends with, because I think we are on the same wavelength. We have struggled with similar issues and thought in similar ways and tried to find answers in the same books and even have similar hobbies. But they have reached shore. They’re now at a better space. And I simply do not know how to converse with them because of the state of me. It’s not shame; it’s more that, the last thing someone would want after they’ve left a bad place is to be reminded of that place. Maybe. Kind of. And obviously I don’t think the state of me leaves a good impression on people.

Every time I see this person on the internet I think about these things. By now you should know I think once I have written something done it would be on the paper (in git) and out of my mind. Hopefully.
