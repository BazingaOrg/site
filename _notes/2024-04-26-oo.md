The Zone of Interest (2023): This reminded me of [Ganz normale Männer](https://muan.co/notes/2023-09-25-uu) in their intentions (I assume) but… done better. Still, it’s unsurprising. It is not more or less horrific than any of the other depictions of the Holocaust. 

Would I recommend me from 3 hours ago to see it? Probably not. But it did lead me down a series of Wikipedia pages starting from [Joseph Wulf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Wulf).
