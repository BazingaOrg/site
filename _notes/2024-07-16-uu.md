Been back in Taipei for 2 weeks now and I have yet been out for anything other than health reasons. The most socialization I got is from two friends visiting me wanting to hear about how was Berlin, and the delivery people (a couple) telling me they missed me. 

Iâ€™ve resumed sessions with my German tutor also! We are becoming good friends.
