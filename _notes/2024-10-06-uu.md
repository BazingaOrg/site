Gestern habe ich meinem Vater etwas über Passwortsicherheit beigebracht und eine junge Politikerin vorgestellt.

I couldn’t find a reputable password manager across OSs without a subscription model and with Traditional Chinese support. :( Bitwarden seems the most promising but the translation for TC is so far behind. I do see our Tech Ministry seems to be working on the open source translation though which is great. But extremely slowly. :/

Perhaps I should just have my dad use my leftover Apple products and use Passwords.
