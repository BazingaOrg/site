> I believe if you have read even one book on Ace you are an expert.

I have read 3! you too can get to the 90 percentile if you just read [The Asexuality Handbook](https://www.asexuality-handbook.com/). Pay attention to the wording. Perhaps go through the glossary first.

I am pushing an asexuality agenda by suggesting more people to learn about it. There's really nothing exciting about it so there's no reason for people to learn about it. 

But we exist. :) Maybe don't ask me about it unless we are IRL friends, just pay attention and learn.
