因為特別到榮總做了睡眠檢查，必須約榮總的精神科醫師，不然我實在一點也不想要看新的醫生。但還好運氣很好，選到溫文的張英杰醫師。醫生讓我打破砂鍋問到底，每個藥的作用都跟我解釋，也提出自己看的研究報告給我參考。甚至預料到我想帶報告回家自己研究的心。推薦給大家（？）。

In the end the sleep analysis only confirmed that my insomnia is not caused by any of the common sleep disorders. As expected, the report showed that I woke up a bunch of times (I recalled only once) and spent 85% of the sleep duration in N2, reduced REM and severe lack of deep sleep. Likely why I have been easily awaken.

He said it seems like my primary doctor has tried two kinds of meds for this. There’s a third kind but it remains to be seen if the first kind works because it was communicated to me as an emergency only pill. 

I guess I hereby declare this an emergency after a streak of choppy 3.5 hours nights of sleep.
