Discussed with friends if I should officially adopt the cats. The answer is yes I need emotional support pets and they need a decent home which I think I am capable of providing. 

Tonight I fed them, they didn’t show much care for me. I approached Mia later as she was staring me down and slow blinked in response to mine a few times. I petted her for about 5-10 minutes and she purred. She still won’t come onto my sofa. But I guess that 5-10 minutes we both felt warm and fuzzy. Hopefully. And that’s what this commitment is about… yea?
