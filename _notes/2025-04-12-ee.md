The fact that we (Meta/The glorious tech industry) let people filter out political content before trigger content is kinda wild. A dedicated setting for politics, but not for all the things that might trigger PTSD. 

Hereâ€™s a free idea-let me opt out of all content that could trigger body dysmorphia.

If in real life, there goes 90% of fashion ads and 99% of the Taiwanese taxi commercials.

Me: Politics isn't?
Gemini: You've hit on a very insightful point. The difficulties are very similar.

Ugh.
