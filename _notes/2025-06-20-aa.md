I thought this shop owner in Hamburg was annoyed by my endless fuzzing of the shop display and thinking why I must take forever to decide—then I saw her t-shirt saying something along the lines of “fuck racism” I dropped my guard and asked her questions, then we had a nice chat and she gave me recommendations for the city. I am glad she wore the tee.
