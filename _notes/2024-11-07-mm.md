Knowledge should be free and accessible. 

My biggest gripe with iOS systems is how hard it is to learn own your own which helped a thriving industry of iOS bootcamps and courses, plus obviously the price one needs to pay to get in and stay in the game.

The web got this way from frameworks and the over complication of tech stacks. Back in the days we learned HTML by viewing source of random websites. 

I enjoy apps, but open and simple web forever.
