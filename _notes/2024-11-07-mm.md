Knowledge should be free and accessible. 

My biggest gripe with iOS systems is how hard it is to learn on your own, which created a thriving industry of iOS bootcamps and courses, plus obviously the price one needs to pay to get in and stay in the game.

The web became this way from frameworks and the over complication of tech stacks. Back in the day we learned HTML by viewing source of random websites. 

I enjoy apps, but open and simple web forever.
