One of the TPP legislator who has a pharmacist background questioned that Freddy Lim as someone who suffers from mental health issues (anxiety from DV) is qualified to be Taiwan’s rep to Finland _considering SAD is prevalent there_. It angers me so much. People with mental health problems are aware and take on challenges with the greatest care and considerations. It’s really not for some rando to comment. I wish there’s something more I can do but there isn’t. I am just mad.
