I feel like I can officially say that I have adopted two cats. This was supposed to be just a fostering program lasting til the end of summer, when I can make the decision to keep them. It’s been a week and their transformation from being in the adoption center to my apartment has been so wild that I can’t fathom putting them back into that situation, where they’ve already stayed for two years. 

They’re two adult female cats, 2.5 and 8.5 years old, 莫膩牙 Niya (nini) and 賴米茶 Mia (mimi). Follow [@muanhq](https://instagram.com/muanhq) for their shenanigans. :)
