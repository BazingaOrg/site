Somehow the political movement currently in Taiwan is almost completely led by women. And we see the occasional man who pops out of nowhere to reap all the fame.

A breath of fresh air today I had a meeting with 3 men about collaborating on tech and lending platforms; they were all respectful and friendly. A principled and ideological bunch. 

How lovely!
