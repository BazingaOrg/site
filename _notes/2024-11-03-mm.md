Friends might have heard me talked about this, and perhaps it’s in one of my blog posts—that I always think if everyday before you wake up, you need to decide whether or not to wake up. Imagine two big round buttons floating in your dreams and you have to pick one. My hypothesis is that many people would have chosen to not. I would too, at 23 I think, when I first thought of this analogy. This is the power of the default. Let users opt-in, not opt-out.
