Hot take Mu-An strikes again. Liking someone is a feeling, loving someone is a skill. 

Lately I’ve been talking to folks about restarting a band.  Oh, little known fact, I used to be in a Muse cover band—I am gradually seeing how people ought to learn to love like how they learn to play an instrument. You simply just don’t go off telling people you play the guitar without ever learning how to. Imagine going to band practice with someone like that, maybe not even bringing a guitar. What the fuck? Don’t waste my time.

What, is this vibe loving?
