Long story short, it feels like I had been working tirelessly for a few weeks when in fact I only just stayed out last night at  protest til 22:30. That is usually when I would have been in bed.

Woke up today and did all the things I set out to do. Had a decent day while feeling extremely fatigue.

There’s another protest tomorrow. I doubt this would be covered in international media. in short, congress majority is trying to pass really really terrible laws. They are the majority but they still opted to forcefully push the bills through instead of going through the… it’s not short anymore, anyways.

When I was in New York during the last Trump presidency, I always think the privileged tech workers should be the first ones to protest, to march, because they can afford to, using their PTOs even. Not the teachers, not the health workers, not the immigrants who are targeted, not the people living paycheck to paycheck. But instead I saw no actions, just money thrown at ACLU. 

As a privileged person who doesn’t need to work, I will go to the protest tomorrow during work hours for those who can’t.
