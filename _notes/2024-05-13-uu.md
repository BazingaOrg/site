Once again I am in a full blown nightmare phase. Multiple nightmares a night. Here’s a note I left for myself at 2:35 AM:

> Nightmare wok logically so I’m. I’m also free on weekdays. Anyways I can’t. I’m tired from emotions in the dreams. to absorbs water.

I remember typing in between dream states.
