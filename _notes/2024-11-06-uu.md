<details><summary>Content warning: depressive episode</summary>OK I know I have talked a lot of shit about people trying stupid methods for suicide attempts, saying things like “clearly they haven’t thought about the fatality rate of this method” because I firmly believe barely dying (and not being able enough to try again) is a worse fate than living with depression. But last night things happened. Now I can finally empathize with that urge to just try whatever, cause the desire to stop living has taken over you. I am sorry to all the people I have judged. Including that guy from The Anatomy of a Fall.</details>
