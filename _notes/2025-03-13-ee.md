<details><summary>Content warning</summary>

It would probably help if I was not alone now. I thought about asking someone to meet but I am waiting for a delivery and I don’t want them to come over.

Heart just ached at the thought of how much my money can help people once they are inherited according to my will. Like it makes so much sense. 

I assume they’ll probably respect the monthly donations I’ve set up which I might cancel. If I wasn’t around they will be here to stay.

I just informed a friend that this is ongoing. What if there’s a push notification thing so I don’t even need to think about what to say?

“Hey. FYI _____ just thought about committing suicide. __ days, resetting.”

Do you think this would pass app store’s content guideline?
