[Wired for Love](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13225387), recommended by new friend [Marcel](https://marcel.io). I finished the audiobook under 6 hours at 1.5×. Pretty sure I wouldn’t have enjoyed reading it but listening was easy (always the case for non-fictions). The book had practical advice for couples who do want to try to work on their relationships, especially for those of us who are not secure/anchor types. They also are somewhat applicable to close friendships. I think I am a wave type disguised naturally as an island for survival. Lots of thanks to Marcel for calling out on my BS when we met for the first time, talking about hyper independence. I definitely wasnt's convicing anyone. 

Relationships between two people should always form an environment where both people can grow and thrive ♥︎.
