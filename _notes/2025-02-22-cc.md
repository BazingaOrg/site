<details><summary>Spoilers: Severance</summary>

Clare asked who I think is the happiest, and I said I don’t think anyone is “happy.”

You see, innie and outie Dylan. Gretchen sees different ranges of the same person. Some pleasant some not. The two Dylans deal with different aspects of life which lead to them presenting a different side of their personality towards Gretchen. Outie Dylan isn’t less kind or considerate or genuine, he simply doesn’t get to be that. If anything I hope this leads to Gretchen seeing how lovable parts of Dylan are and not the other way around.

Also, men are idiots.
