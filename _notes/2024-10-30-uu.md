Now I officially do not have Facebook, Instagram, or Threads installed! I will try to be more Web 1.0 on muan dot co!

Finally added support for video stories for OpenStories and was trying to add support for it on my site too. CF stream is what I am testing with.

Also, [a Public API for OpenHearts](https://github.com/dddddddddzzzz/api-oh); not sure if I had mentioned it here. Get emoji reactions on your website, today!
