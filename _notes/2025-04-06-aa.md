[It is now next week](https://muan.co/notes/2025-03-31-aa).

Friend: we still meeting?
Me: uh. I think not. We are both busy. The commute would waste too much of our time and energy. Better save the time for work.
Friend: :’( Okay.
Me: You said you don’t mind either way, yea?
Friend: Are you OK?

Well.
