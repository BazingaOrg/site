Therapy note (finally):

I have great instincts it turned out. But I didn’t trust them. I dismissed them, went down familiar paths, and looked for alternative explanations; which only caused myself distress with no way out. Turmoils that were theoretically avoidable. At least future turmoils like those can be avoided from now on… right?

Must remember and internalize these things and rewire my brain.
