Shipping things without accessibility baked in is shipping broken things. 

“But we can’t let accessibility halt progress.” Well then fucking do something about it????!!!!! 

The reason you can’t let accessibility halt progress is because it’s not important enough to you. It’s ableism, plain and simple. Some things can block release but not accessibility — this speaks VOLUMES.

This isn’t going to change anyone’s mind, but I’m just saying. I see ableism at work.
