Therapy note: Imagine I am a stock.

Before 2020 this stock has been steadily rising in value and charted multiple ventures. Very promising. In 2020 the company’s main business folded, the board got insomnia we saw a huge dip. In 2022 the board got depression, another big dip. In 2023 the company receive a federal contract which saw a rise in price, but then early 2024 the contract was dropped. In the coming times we see the stock continuing to drop in price albeit still having ups and downs, averaging downwards, towards penny stock stage.

The company can take itself private or file for bankruptcy. The board is tired and depressed and wants to file for bankruptcy.

But as an investor who plans to hold the stock for long term, one might say that you have 20 years history of the stock steadily rising in value, a few years of hiccups isn’t something to be make that big deal of. Hold, and look for the long term return. Meanwhile new investors aren’t likely to choose this given the recent history. People who have seen the glory days might continue to hold. But anyways, try to look at the market as a long term investor.
