On the topic of the non-existence of the free will™ (imagine my YouTube home page now) I guess some people may be predisposed to introducing variables into their lives while others aren’t. When unknown variables are inputted in the program that is our brains it produces something unexpected than if little variables were introduced. This makes a spectrum of people, I think? Ones that have had been exposed to lots of variables so it’s more likely that more perspectives of our society have been examined, and on the other end of the spectrum are the tunnel-visioned. 

No value judgements here. It could be a really nice tunnel.
I am just vomiting out words.
