For all the people who have told me they love me, none of them “love” love me. I need them to know that every time they repeat this, what I hear is “I love you just this much, and that is the most I can, that is still far from the societal bar to qualify this as a relationship.” 

This is the best I can get. Not nearly there. Never enough.

Hold on to the people who “love” love you.
