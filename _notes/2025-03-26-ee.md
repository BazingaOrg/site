Of all the people who have told me they love me, none of them “love” love me. I need them to know that every time they repeat this, what I hear is “I love you just this much, and that is the most possible, that is still far from the societal bar for qualifying this as a _relationship_.” 

Not nearly there. Never enough.

Hold onto the people who “love” love you.
