Been deeply entrenched in Taiwanese politics, and for the first time since I am back I feel like there might be a community of people that are actually on the same wavelength as me? I guess Threads getting ultra popular in Taiwan turned out to be a good thing. That said, transferring these connections offline is still a priority. Living with social media is really unideal. 

Without a town square it would have been impossible for people to organize like this, but it comes with a lot of drawbacks and itâ€™s a silo after all. 

Damn, tech people really failed to solve this problem. So much for changing the world. How much can the world change if the framework remains the same?
