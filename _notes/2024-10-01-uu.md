Something that has helped me make decisions on whether to spend time on something, is to think about if doing that thing yields me more value than the monetary value that could be derived from charging my hourly tech job rate, which is above US tech average/which I also luckily don’t *need* to do anymore. (childfree cat lady here with no dependents)

Meeting a random stranger for coffee? No.
Arguing with eggs on the internet? No.
Finding an alternative electrician that might be marginally cheaper? No.
Tracking down each of my neighbors to reimburse me for the staircase cleaning fee I prepaid for the year? No.

Peace and quiet is priceless.

This is a very privileged position obviously. Most of the unpleasant interpersonal situations I have been in, in the last years, have been related to this value judgement. Like “you should ask for more money” “you shouldn’t let them take advantage of you” “you don’t have to pay someone to do this” etc. Ma’am/Sir, I lose more money (=energy/time) just standing here listening to you talk.

Never again having to engage with someone who drains my time, energy, and happiness… is like winning lotteries.
