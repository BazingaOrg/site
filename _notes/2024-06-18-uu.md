> Never say sorry about living your life ♡ I don’t expect responses in timely manners

Epiphany today is true friends are people I don’t worry that will judge me because I did something weird or bad or out of character. They love/trust me enough to be like, you must have a good reason. I’ll accept this, and follow up to check if you’re good as needed.

That makes it ok to fail outside of the comfort zone because THERE IS A COMFORT ZONE to return to.

My therapist is going to be so proud of me for accepting that I do have friends and they are fucking lovely.
