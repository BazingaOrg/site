On [JavaScript dos and donts](https://muan.co/posts/javascript). Critiquing of the use of JS on my site:

- `navigator.share`.
- `Intl.DateTimeFormat` & custom relative time.
- `fetch` remote text, see [Client side include feature for HTML](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2791).
- `<open-heart>`: Unnecessarily requires JS. I should do better. But I already do have a non-JS solution for people who read my notes via RSS.
- `<open-stories>`: JSON Feed based content that include expiry timestamp, history tracking. I could provide a non-JS alternative but that will be non-trivial since source of content is JSON.
