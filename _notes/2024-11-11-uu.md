On [JavaScript dos and donts](https://muan.co/posts/javascript). Let's self-critique the use of JavaScript on my site:

Content:
- `fetch` remote text, see [Client side include feature for HTML](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2791). This is the status text under my name on the home page. Failure case: visitors don't see my current status, I think it is a nice to have.
- `<open-stories>`: JSON Feed based content that include expiry timestamp, history tracking. I could provide a non-JS alternative but that will be non-trivial since source of content is JSON. Failure case: visitors can't view my stories. That is sad because I have so much content in there.

Non-core content/interaction:
- `navigator.share`. Hopefully this can be added into HTML standards with some combination of [`commandfor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Invoker_Commands_API) and `id/for` mechanism.
- `Intl.DateTimeFormat` & custom relative time.
- `<open-heart>`: Unnecessarily requires JS. I should do better. But I already do have a non-JS solution for people who read my notes via RSS.
