I am finding it hard to disconnect from the internet in Taipei than in Berlin. In Berlin it is very easy to ignore the goingons in Taiwan from time zone difference, but in Taipei I somehow get to talk to all the people in all the timezones all the time. It’s a problem.

Though at the same time I did text my Taipei friend when I was in Berlin

> I am busy living my Berlin life. Talk to you when I get back.

Perhaps it is because I was out all the time in Berlin. Perhaps it is because Berlin is temporary. What’s fleeting needs to be grasped. [Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhgta611Pls).
