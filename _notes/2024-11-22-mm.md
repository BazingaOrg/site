I learned that there was a [proposal for External Link Unicode character](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2018/18303-external-link.pdf) the other day but couldn’t find out what happened to it, so I wrote the author Devin Bayer a cold email. They responded the next day, and I quote:

> they rejected the proposal quickly with the reasoning that the external link is not usually used in plain text. It’s usually used in HTML documents, where tags are available. So for example, a browser could render `<a rel="external">x</a>` with the external link symbol.

What a bummer, but it does make sense. For now I have added little corners to the external links on muan.co. I did not check for browser compatibility so do tell me if they seem weird. 

Shoutout to the-actually-better-than-me web developer iOS developer [@robb](https://robb.is) for telling me about `content: text / alt-text`.
