I told two people on the call that I live amongst trash and the rest of you through an earlier note so I took some of the trash out earlier.

FYI in Taiwan you need to go to a trash truck at a designated time for your neighborhood if you donâ€™t live in a managed building. And that time is very close to my bed time. I am justifying my laziness.

Please reward me for adulting.
