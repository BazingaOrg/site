Accidentally uttered “I am almost 40” when a shop owner commented on how young I seemed. It is technically true, but I really don’t feel 36. The last few years flew by–if I celebrate birthdays it might have felt more “completed.”

I gained more experience points but has not leveled up for a long while. I don’t think I am getting a clearer picture of what it is that I want. More possible futures have been eliminated if anything.

However, I do always have the desire to be better. Not kinder, but wiser, more skillful, more intelligent, more knowledgeable, and so forth. I have not worked on that for a long time. How disappointing.
