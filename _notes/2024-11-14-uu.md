People who put tracking pixels in their emails cannot be my friends.

Someone had reached out to me many years ago quite rudely–a white nomadic “entrepreneur” demanding to meet me in person without even a self-introduction, just “people said you are it, in the Taiwanese tech scene”—guess these people don’t know me enough to make an intro, huh? So I didn’t respond, and shared the email to some friends saying “the audacity,” then the guy followed-up multiple times, eventually saying “I see you opening my emails a lot but don’t respond. Why?” with a screenshot of his email tracking app.

Instant block. Since then I have **do not load images** set as default on all email clients.

The lack of self-awareness is staggering.

This also makes me sad regarding how non-tech-savvy people are being tracked without them being aware.
