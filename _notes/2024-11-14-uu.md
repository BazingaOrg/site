People who put tracking pixels in their emails cannot be my friends.

Someone had reached out to me many years ago quite rudely (a white nomadic “entrepreneur” demanding to meet me in person without even a self-introduction, just “people said you are it, in the Taiwanese tech scene”—guess these people don’t know me enough to make an intro, huh?) so I shared the email to some friends saying “the audacity,” then the guy followed-up multiple times, eventually saying “I see you opening my emails a lot but don’t respond. Why?” 

Instant block. Since then I stop loading images on all email clients.

The lack of self-awareness is staggering.
