Let the record like that I really didn’t try to kill myself last night, but I almost died. Having this experience, maybe next time I will think twice before calling an ambulance.

Anyways, I was at the ER because I had a fever of 40+° Celsius and shook uncontrollably for hours.

It seems like not taking this SNRI could kill me, but taking them could kill me too. Win win?
