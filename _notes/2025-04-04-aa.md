Honestly kinda annoyed that I am not rich enough to throw around capital at artists who support Taiwan Independence. Robert Tsao (founder of another semi conductor company in Taiwan) is rich enough and is throwing money at people but I really think I can do it better.

Should I slave away for more money?
