I gave Apple Music a go and it really disappointed me. Not that I had high expectations, but I expected it to just… work? how bad can a music streaming software be?

The UI is terrible: I struggle to find buttons/playlist/queue all the time. I misclick things all the time. I try to go to an album from a song and it works half of the time.

Non-existent social features: Sharing music to Apple or non-Apple users are both a pain, let alone playlists. 

The last straw for me is… localization: As a multi-lingual person… I cannot bear not being able to find a song I know definitely exist just because of the UI language I chose. I cannot find artists/songs by their names in Chinese/Japanese just because Apple gives me only one set of data. Not that they should’ve showed all, but the source of truth in my opinion should always be the original language.

And turned out, I used the Karaoke feature exactly 0 times after I switched. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

That’ll be all. For your references.
