I finally *called* to have the many water filters in my apartment changed, after living here for 3 years, cause who calls companies anymore??? I ended up chatting with the technician that came, around 50s, about furniture design and tactile feedback(?), cause he recognized my lounge chair (not Eames). I told him where to find Scandinavian vintage wares online and in Taiwan. It was nice.
