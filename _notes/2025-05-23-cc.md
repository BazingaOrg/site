Last night I booked a theater to host a viewing for the movie [Invisible Nation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28853268/), managed to fill the room, and gave everyone limited edition WUFI symbol posters we designed ♡. I did good.

It is Taiwan propaganda, and a good one. Please try to find it and watch it, and become a fan of Taiwan.

> 做為一個台灣人，沒有選擇坐在家裡的權利，我們只有一個選項，就是每一個台灣人都要走出去，走到世界各地每個角落，讓世界看見台灣。–蔡英文

> As Taiwanese, we don’t have the option to sit at home. We only have one choice, and that is that every Taiwanese has to go out, to every corner of the world, and make the world see Taiwan. –Tsai Ing-Wen

I shall plan my future accordingly.
