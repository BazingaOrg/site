I reached out to an ex-coworker in government for some rubber ducking. He’s very calm and kind, I guess. Not that I am not kind, but I give zero inches to people across the political aisle. I wanted to know what a person who can always assume the best out of people would do in my situation.

In the call, unrelatedly, I said:

> And of course I made sure everything is accessible. lighthouse 100% across the board is the baseline, and I got J to audit the site, there’s an accessibility statement from the get go, et cetera. 

He smiled. I saw that smile and remembered how we used to care hard about our project, and discussed all these unnegotiable principles. It is a shame that we weren’t able to follow it through, but it was really nice, working with people who know why we all need these extra days and weeks to do things *right*.

It’s not about perfectionism, it’s able access for all, it’s able insisiting on a certain quality as a baseline. 

No half-assing.
I miss working with people like that.
I miss working with people who appreciates that I work like that.
