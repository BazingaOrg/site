People, I’m glad to announced I have been feeling feelings, good and bad. But that’s because I am caring for things! I am dedicating myself to a number of things that *matter* to me which is oh so unfamiliar. These aren’t just going through the motions. I care about these experiences and the outcome of them. I feel normal somewhat. It is exciting but also scary because not being stoic is risky. But progress? Or I guess change? Is good?
