Politics everywhere seems fucked. I am glad here in Taiwan we have something to try, and are trying.

It felt extremely frustrating in the beginning, but once I met people IRL and got to befriend some like-minded competent people, everything became rewarding in and of itself. The outcome is obviously still important, but the experience of working on social change with amazing people is irreplaceble.
