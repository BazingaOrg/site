I like seeing my therapist cry. It is a sign that she listened and understood. As a licensed therapist, she has to play the role of a caring person. I know it is _her job_, but that’s better than nothing.

In the latest session, I described the bleakness in the ongoing act of _killing myself_(idiom) in order to survive, for naught.

I asked why she had to help people live, why if she understands why dying is preferable for some, there still exists a profession that makes sure all people live? What’s the logic in that? 

I scoffed at “the continuation of the human race.” Lotta good we have done to nature and animals.
