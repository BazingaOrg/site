Since a friend asked me, I would also add it here— if a friend is thinking about taking a programming or design course online, a very general rule of thumb is to run the course website under https://pagespeed.web.dev and see if it is at least all green. If not, don’t waste the time and money.

It doesn’t matter which programming workshop it is, a good engineer or designer care about their products, to want to apply their disciplines and values on all of their work.

I don’t have perfect websites. I also don’t charge huge sum of money to teach people. The web is free.
