A friend sent me a design course by a web designer and asked me if she should take it, I figure I put my way of responding here—a general rule of thumb is to run the course website under https://pagespeed.web.dev and see if it is at least all green. If not, don’t waste the time and money.

It doesn’t matter which design or programming workshop it is, a good engineer or designer cares about their products, therefore should want to apply their disciplines and values on all of their work.

I don’t have a perfect website. I also don’t charge huge sum of money to teach people. The web is free.

Lastly, when I saw the site I immediately spotted multiple visual accessibility issues. The lighthouse check was just to make it impartial.

I added also to my friend:

> There are indeed many industry thought leaders in their testimonials, but you know how I feel about thought leaders. And most of the time, if you have the clut, the testimonial comes for free and means nothing.
