[I accidentally started a ‘Silent Book Club’ at my local coffee shop](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/s/SJXt3YPXLD)—cute. If only I liked to go outside. Actually, I just bought some proper coffee beans, streamed line my morning coffee routine, and promised myself to not buy coffee outside or order coffee again.
