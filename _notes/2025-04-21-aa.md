Doc said that he wants to simplify my prescription. I panicked and asked why and said I’ve felt safe with two particular pills, and he said never mind, let’s keep them. 

I feel like he was too easily swayed and said please don’t be affected by my unprofessional opinions, I have no expertise. But he said “you know yourself, and my whole job is making sure you don’t feel anxious.” Ugh.
