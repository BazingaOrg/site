The topic of the therapy session this week is: why didn’t I get closure at the end of things? I thought the materialistic rewards would help but they didn’t. I needed something more, or something else. I needed to know that the decade of harm and misplaced trust amounted to something more. And turned out they did. It’s all in the XP I gained. At least I leveled up. There won’t be a next time.
