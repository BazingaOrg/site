One of my depressed friends took comfort in the fact that I can’t take shower regularly (taking a shower is an achievement I log). Yet I am much more outward-facingly productive. I also haven’t taken out trash for a good while and I live with two cats. 

The only thing I can semi-consistently do is keeping my sink empty, and I do vacuum/sweep daily cause otherwise I’d be covered in cat hair (looking at Mité).
