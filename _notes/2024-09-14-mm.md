I love the idea of Cillian Murphy. Unconventionally attractive, down to earth, humble, cares about history and his local community (speaks Gaelic, stars in historic Irish films). I naturally assume he speaks other languages too and is an empathetic human being.

Same reason why I love the idea of Damien Rice. He once remarked in a concert in Iceland about islander solidarity (me too an islander). However perhaps he has revealed too much about his love life through art that hinted he might or might not be a bit toxic. But his authenticity coming from the showcase of vulnerability is also a very good trait.
