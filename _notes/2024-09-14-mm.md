I love the idea of Cillian Murphy. Unconventionally attractive, down to earth, super talented yet humble, cares about history and his local communities (speaks Gaelic, stars in, produces historic Irish films). I naturally assume he speaks other languages to and is an empathetic human being who supports doing what is right. A++

Same reason why I love the idea of Damien Rice. He once remarked in a concert in Iceland about island nation solidarity (me too an island national). However perhaps he has revealed too much about his love life through art that hinted he might or might not be a bit problematic. Meanwhile he has also collaborated with indie films, non-profits for children and climate change with amazing songs that [most people would never hear](https://youtu.be/Om2lWnQrWCk), unless like me they stalk him and buy these works on bandcamp. His authenticity coming from the display of vulnerability is also a very good trait. 

Anyways these are two of my favorite public figures. Those who are only public as a side affect of their talents.
