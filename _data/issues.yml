#   title: "Client side include feature for HTML"
#   note: "[GitHub uses `<include-fragment>`](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2791#issuecomment-408193859) since 2014. Honestly I am quite tired of the argument of _this can be done in JavaScript already_ as if what comes first negates the need for the latter, perhaps easier, more accessible (in terms of usability and barrier of entry), and semantic approach."
